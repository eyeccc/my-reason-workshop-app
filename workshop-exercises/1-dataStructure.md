1. Data Structures
Create a data-structure for a chess figure with the following attributes: color, position, kind

The color can be either black / white
The position has 2 dimensions on a typical chess board
The kind describes the value of the figure (king, tower, pawn â€¦)
Put your data-structures in action by storing 2 chess figures in a collection called figures:

Figure 1: Black, King, on position A1
Figure 2: White, Tower, on position C7
I recommend to use the playground for this example: https://reasonml.github.io/en/try

Alternative playground: https://sketch.sh/

Tip: You may use lists, arrays, tuples, variants for these tasks
